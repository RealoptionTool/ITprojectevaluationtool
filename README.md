# Valuation for Real Options in IT Investment Projects
The [valuation tool for real options in IT investment projects (ITIPs)](https://personal-2u8rb8tg.outsystemscloud.com/OptionvaluationITIPs/Login) estimates the value of strategic growth options for ITIPs. The tool is based on the modified assumptions of the typical Black-Scholes Model (BSM) derived in the research project "Real Option Analysis in Digital Transformation Programs" (P 32578) funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). The valuation tool allows all inflows and outflows to follow either a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) or an Exponential Mean Reversion (EMR). Also, each in- and outflow can be subjected to unforeseeable events (referred to as "jumps" in Müller et al., 2016) that may affect the value of the strategic growth option. These unforeseeable events are modeled using a lognormally distributed random variable. The valuation tool assumes that the market is complete, which implies that all risk subjected to the strategic growth option is hedgeable. The option runtime can be uncertain but is consiered to have a minimum option runtime. This means that the tool can simulate delays in the runtime of strategic growth options, but it cannot simulate that the underlying ITIP is completed before initially planned.

To use the tool, users can either log in with the public account "Andrea McKenzie" or register and use their own account to see only the strategic growth options for ITIPs that they have created. After logging in, users can either calculate the option value of a new strategic growth option for ITIPs or an existing strategic growth option that is already stored in the database. When creating a new strategic growth option, one has to provide a name, the risk-free interest rate that should be used for calculation, and the minimum option runtime. If the option runtime is uncertain, one has to determine all risk scenarios that can increase the option runtime. Users must provide the tool with all cash in- or outflows subjected to the strategic growth option. If an in- or outflow is subjected to uncertainties, one has to provide certain characteristics of the cash flow that determine whether the cash flow follows GBM or EMR and whether jumps should be modeled. Before starting the simulation, users can change or add all provided information. Starting the simulation, the tool returns the expected value of the strategic growth option, the return on investment, and the 95% confidence interval of the estimation based on 100,000 simulations.
